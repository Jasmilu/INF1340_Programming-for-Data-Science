#The US Census Bureau projects population based on the following assumptions:
#One birth every 7 seconds
#One death every 13 seconds
#One new immigrant every 45 seconds
#Write a program to display the population for each of the next five years. Assume the current population is 312032486 and one year has 365 days.

#x computes seconds in one year
x= 365*24*60*60
#y is current population
y = 312032486
#b computes birth number in one year
b = int(x/7)
#d computes death number in one year
d = int(x/13)
#i computes new immigrant number in one year
i = int(x/45)
#p1 computes assumpted population in next one year
p1 = y + b -d + i
print(p1)
#p2 computes assumpted population in next two year
p2 = y + 2*b - 2*d + 2*i
print(p2)
#p3 computes assumpted population in next three year
p3 = y + 3*b - 3*d + 3*i
print(p3)
#p4 computes assumpted population in next four year
p4 = y + 4*b - 4*d + 4*i
print(p4)
#p5 computes assumpted population in next five year
p5 = y + 5*b - 5*d + 5*i
print(p5)
